# IMC calculation with Javascript

## Project Description
<p>This project simulates a nutritional table that displays the patient, its height, weight and grease to calculate its IMC. Besides, it contents a form to add new patients and a filter that can be applied to find a specific patient usind regex. </p>

<!--table content-->
<!--ts-->
   <p>This application uses just one page where displays a table that contains info about patients like: name, height, weight, grease and IMC (that is calculated with the Javascript). </p>
   <p> On this course we learn to develop and apply validation logics in forms, so that for example, invalid weights and heights are highlighted and thus the BMI is not calculated. The event question was learned, where the application was done by double clicking on the line to exclude the patient. Another application of event control along with the use of regular expressions was in the filter, where the filter is performed as it is typed.
Therefore, in addition to the table, the course allowed the creation of a form to insert new patients where, provided the data is correct, when clicking the button to add, it is already displayed in the table, and a filter, for one occasion research among patients.
All functionalities were also exercised along with good practices, such as separating functions and even files, in order to facilitate maintenance and maintain a simple and readable code. </p>
  <p>At the end of the construction, the AJAX concepts were understood, together with the request for an API to include new patients obtained directly from the API, further consolidating the knowledge of the content</p>
